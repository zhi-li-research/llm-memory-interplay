Gen\u00e9e, however, wrote the operetta's actual text and drew nothing from Haffner beyond the names of the characters. Gen\u00e9e was born in Danzig.

The song's lyrics pertain to despair over being left by someone you love; some critics noted a comparison to the lyrics of the song to Jackson's single, \"Billie Jean\", from the album Thriller. As part of the promotion for the song, two music videos were released in 1992. The song was not performed by Jackson on any of his world concert tours.

It was originally composed for harpsichord or fortepiano and scored for an orchestra in a relatively undeveloped galant style evident in his early works, and has a lively Hungarian Rondo finale. On the other hand, being a somewhat later composition, it also shows more similarities to Mozart's piano concertos than do Haydn's other keyboard concertos.
