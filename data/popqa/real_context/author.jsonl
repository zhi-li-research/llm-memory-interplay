During the novel, Yessah befriends two white doves, 'Peace' and 'Goodwill', who become his friends during the Ark's voyage. He also saves the Ark from sinking at one point when the lower decks become too waterlogged, resulting in the portholes starting to sink under the water; by having the large animals plug the portholes with their bottoms, he is able to buy time to pump the water out. After Peace is sent away to find land, the Ark eventually stops, with the rest of the family leaving the Ark while Yessah is out searching the mountain of Ararat. Despite his solitude, Yessah concludes that he has a good life, living for the rest of his life with Peace and Goodwill."}]}

The plot centres on \"accidental bigamy\" which was in literary fashion in the early 1860s. The plot was summarised by literary critic Elaine Showalter (1982): \"Braddon's bigamous heroine deserts her child, pushes husband number one down a well, thinks about poisoning husband number two and sets fire to a hotel in which her other male acquaintances are residing\". Elements of the novel mirror themes of the real-life Constance Kent case of June 1860 which gripped the nation for years. A follow-up novel, Aurora Floyd, appeared in 1863.

In Mixed Feelings, Cvetkovich primarily explores the politics of affect in relation to Victorian sensationalism in the 1860s and 1870s. While she focuses mostly on traditional Victorian sensation novels such as Mary Elizabeth Braddon's Lady Audley's Secret, Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White, and Ellen Wood's East Lynne, she also looks at works that are not typically read as Victorian sensationalism. One chapter looks at George Eliot's Daniel Deronda, where she reads Gwendolen's \u201cdramatic interiority\u201d in relation to the affective power of sensation novels. Another reads Karl Marx's Capital as a sensationalist narrative; while most of the works Cvetkovich studies sensationalize the figure of the middle-class woman, Capital sensationalizes the male worker's body. Although Mixed Feelings focuses primarily on Victorian sensationalism, the book also contains discussions of AIDS activism and the politics of affect in relation to ACT UP."}]}

Coup de lune has much in common with the noir fiction subgenre of hardboiled detective fiction, and could be described as being a \"colonial noir\" story, though arguably there are also some existential elements present in the narrative.

Aspects is widely considered to be the foundational document and a proper book-length articulation of Chomskyan theoretical framework of linguistics. It presented Chomsky's epistemological assumptions with a view to establishing linguistic theory-making as a formal (i.e. based on the manipulation of symbols and rules) discipline comparable to physical sciences, i.e. a domain of inquiry well-defined in its nature and scope. From a philosophical perspective, it directed mainstream linguistic research away from behaviorism, constructivism, empiricism and structuralism and towards mentalism, nativism, rationalism and generativism, respectively, taking as its main object of study the abstract, inner workings of the human mind related to language acquisition and production."}]}

The novel, Zabuzhko's third, is a modern multigenerational saga which covers the years 1940 to 2004, framed as investigations by a journalist, Daryna Hoshchynska, of historical events in western Ukraine including the Holodomor, the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, and later political changes, ending just before the Orange Revolution. The book won the 2010 award for best Ukrainian book, presented by Korrespondent magazine, and the 2013 Angelus Central European Literature Award, presented by the City of Wroclaw.

Almost forty years after its initial publication, the novel returned to the bestseller list in 2011. On its publication, the book received praise from some prominent conservative French literary figures but has been widely criticized or dismissed by both French and English language commentators. It is controversial and has often been denounced as racist and xenophobic, especially due to its anti-immigration themes. The Southern Poverty Law Center has compared the book to The Turner Diaries, attributing its popularity with white nationalists to the plot's parallels with the white genocide conspiracy theory."}]}

Unusually for a Hardy novel, the ending is not entirely tragic; however, there remains an ominous element in the probable fate of one of the main characters. The novel is set in Weymouth during the Napoleonic wars; the town was then anxious about the possibility of invasion by Napoleon. Of the two brothers, John fights with Wellington in the Peninsular War, and Bob serves with Nelson at Trafalgar. The Napoleonic Wars was a setting that Hardy would use again in his play, The Dynasts, and it borrows from the same source material.

The novel is written as supposedly dictated to a visitor to the nursing home of ninety-nine-year-old Lucy Marsden, who was married around 1900 when she was 15 and her husband, Captain William Marsden, was 50. Through this motif, the novel explores issues of race and personal relationships in the historical context of the American South. According to the author's web site, \"If Captain William Marsden was a veteran of the 'War for Southern Independence,' Lucy became a 'veteran of the veteran' with a unique perspective on Southern history and Southern manhood. Her story encompasses everything from the death of a Confederate boy soldier to the feisty narrator's daily battles in the Home &mdash; complete with visits from a mohawk-coiffed candy-striper.\""}]}

The clouds may be those of Aristophanes' play, The Clouds, which ridiculed Socrates and the intellectual fashions of the time.

Stevenson's Treasure Island (1883) is considered the most influential work of pirate fiction, along with its many film and television adaptations, and introduced or popularised many of the characteristics and cliches now common to the genre. Stevenson identified Johnson's General History of the Pyrates as one of his major influences, and even borrowed one character's name (Israel Hands) from a list of Blackbeard's crew which appeared in Johnson's book."}]}

In the estimation of many critics the piece is Ibsen's masterwork, only equalled by The Wild Duck of 1884. As expressed by the protagonist, Rosmer, the theme of the play is social and political change, in which the traditional ruling classes relinquish their right to impose their ideals on the rest of society, but the action is entirely personal, resting on the conduct of the immoral, or amoral, \"free thinking\" heroine, Rebecca, who sets herself to undermine Rosmer's religious and political beliefs because of his influential position in the community. Rebecca has abandoned not only Christianity but, unlike Rosmer, she has abandoned the whole ethical system of Christianity as well. Possibly she may be taken as Ibsen's answer to the question of whether or not Christian ethics can be expected to survive the death of the Christian religion.
