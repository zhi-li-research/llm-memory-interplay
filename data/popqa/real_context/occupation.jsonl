As a journalist, he was part of a wave of philosophically positivist and politically progressive writers who carried the mantle of Mazzini's republican nationalism in the late 19th century. From 1887 to 1890 he founded and edited the review 'Cuore e Critica' which, together with the journals La rivista repubblicana and L'educazione politica, was important in defining the republican ideology of the times. Politically, Ghisleri was close to the revolutionary movements of his time: in 1895 he was one of the founders of the Italian Republican Party. His friend and fellow radical Filippo Turati took over the journal in 1891 and renamed it Critica Sociale, moving it quickly into a socialist direction.

He studied the orangutan, the javan rhinoceros, and the skull of a mosasaur, which he believed was a whale. Camper was a celebrity in Europe and became a member of the Royal Society (1750), the G\u00f6ttingen (1779), and Russian Academy of Sciences (1778), the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1783), the French (1786) and the Prussian Academy of Sciences (1788). He designed and constructed tools for his patients, and for surgeries. He was amateur-drawer, a sculptor, a patron of art and a conservative, royalist politician.

Written between 1921 and 1927, the first two works (Kammermusik No. 1 and Kleine Kammermusik \u2014 Little Chamber Music) are for small ensembles (12 piece and wind quintet respectively), and share the opus number 24. Kammermusik No. 2 to Kammermusik No. 5 (Opus 36) are for larger ensembles and are concertos. The final two works form Opus 46. As Calum MacDonald notes, the majority of the works are not 'chamber music' in the traditional sense of the word, as they require larger forces than normally understood by the term. Indeed, six are effectively concertos (Hindemith's subtitles say as much). However, in contrast to the much larger forces (and sounds) Hindemith previously employed, the works are very much chamber-styled if not truly chamber works."}]}
